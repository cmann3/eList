Description:
    Create list comprehensions (and other types of comprehension) similar to those in
    'python', 'haskell', and other languages. List comprehension in 'R' converts a 
    regular for() loop into a vectorized lapply() function. Support for looping 
    with multiple variables, parallelization, and across non-standard objects included. Package 
    also contains a variety of functions to help with list comprehension and 
    higher order functions for manipulating lists.
